## About Me

Think big. Think different. 

I am Chenwei Zhang (<span class="ma-shan-zheng-regular">张晨伟</span> in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) under the co-supervision of Prof. [Anne Condon](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/) and Prof. [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/). I am also affiliated with the [Algorithm Lab (Beta Lab)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/). I obtained my MSc degree under the supervision of Prof. [Pavle Radovanovic](http://pavlegroup.uwaterloo.ca/) from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) in 2021. I earned a dual Bachelor's degree from the University of Waterloo (Dean’s Honours List) and [Beijing Jiaotong University (China)](http://en.njtu.edu.cn) in 2018. 
My research focuses on developing advanced deep learning algorithms to solve real-world problems in the field of AI4Science. I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, particularly in generative models and multimodal learning. I am also passionate about large language models and AI agents.


## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** Generative Models (Diffusion Models, GANs, VAEs, etc.), Large Language Models, AI Agent, Multimodal Learning, Visualization
- **AI4Science:** Protein Structure Modeling, AI4Healthcare, Drug Discovery, DNA Kinetics

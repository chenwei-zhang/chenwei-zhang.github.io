## About Me

Think big. Think different. 

I am Chenwei Zhang (张晨伟 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) under the co-supervision of Prof. [Anne Condon](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/) and Prof. [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/). I am also affiliated with the [Algorithm Lab (Beta Lab)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/). Since June 2023, I have been undertaking my internship at [Amgen Canada](https://www.amgen.ca/). I obtained my MSc degree under the supervision of Prof. [Pavle Radovanovic](http://pavlegroup.uwaterloo.ca/) from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) in 2021. I earned a dual Bachelor's degree from the University of Waterloo (Dean’s Honours List) and [Beijing Jiaotong University (China)](http://en.njtu.edu.cn) in 2018.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, graph embedding, multimodal learning, visualization
- **AI4Science:** protein atomic model reconstruction, Cryo-EM density map analysis, DNA kinetics


## News

- **[📌News📌]** I made a [paper list](https://github.com/chenwei-zhang/Papers-atomic-model-building-in-CryoEM-maps) that collects different SOTA ML, DL or other advanced computational approaches for protein atomic model building.
- **[Sept. 2023]** 🗣️ I presented a [poster](./assets/files/vida_DNA29_poster.pdf) at [DNA29](https://dna29.org/index.html) conference in Sendai, Japan.
- **[Sept. 2023]** 🗣️ I gave a [talk](https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5142/videos/watch/202309071601-Zhang.html) at [BIRS](https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5142) workshop in Banff, Canada.
- **[Jul. 2023]** 🎉 Our [paper](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2023/18788/) on revisiting hybridization kinetics with Bayesian inference is accepted to DNA29.

## About Me

Think big. Think different. 

I am Chenwei Zhang (<span class="ma-shan-zheng-regular">张晨伟</span> in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) under the co-supervision of Prof. [Anne Condon](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/) and Prof. [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/). I am also affiliated with the [Algorithm Lab (Beta Lab)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/). I obtained my MSc degree under the supervision of Prof. [Pavle Radovanovic](http://pavlegroup.uwaterloo.ca/) from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) in 2021. I earned a dual Bachelor's degree from the University of Waterloo (Dean’s Honours List) and [Beijing Jiaotong University (China)](http://en.njtu.edu.cn) in 2018. From June 2023 to June 2024, I have been undertaking my one-year internship at [Amgen Canada](https://www.amgen.ca/) as a role of machine learning scientist.

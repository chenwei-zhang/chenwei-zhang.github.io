    abs: "Synthetic biologists and molecular programmers design novel nucleic acid reactions, with many potential applications. Good visualization tools are needed to help domain experts make sense of the complex outputs of folding pathway simulations of such reactions. Here we present ViDa, a new approach for visualizing DNA reaction folding trajectories over the energy landscape of secondary structures. We integrate a deep graph embedding model with common dimensionality reduction approaches, to map high-dimensional data onto 2D Euclidean space. We assess ViDa on two well-studied and contrasting DNA hybridization reactions. Our preliminary results suggest that ViDa's visualization successfully separates trajectories with different folding mechanisms, thereby providing useful insight to users, and is a big improvement over the current state-of-the-art in DNA kinetics visualization."

    abs: "Controlling magnetic and magneto-optical properties of transparent metal oxide semiconductors has a significant potential for spintronics and photonics. Although ferromagnetism has been reported for several nanostructured transparent metal oxides in the absence of magnetic dopants, its origin and the nature of the exchange interactions remain controversial. Here, we report a variable-temperatureâ€“variable-field magnetic circular dichroism study of ZnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals prepared under oxidizing and reducing conditions. We observe the band splitting in ZnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals induced by localized doublet (S = 1/2) and triplet (S = 1) ground states, respectively. Photoluminescence measurements suggest that these states are associated with oxygen vacancies, either as isolated paramagnetic sites in ZnO or as local vacancy-based complexes in SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals. The results of this work demonstrate the ability to tune carrier polarization in metal oxide nanocrystals by in situ control of the native defect formation and attest to the anomalous Zeeman splitting of the band states, which may play an important role in generating ferromagnetism in this class of materials."

    abs: "Moore's Law will soon be inadequate to keep up with the needs of technological developments as the currently used materials have reached their natural performance limits. Hence, the development of a new technology to replace traditional semiconductor electronics is imminent. Spintronics has been emerged as a promising alternative to control charge properties as well as electron spin to improve the device performance. Metal oxide and chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have generated much research due to their unique properties and relatively low cost. In contrast to noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), the semiconductor NCs with tunable free charge carrier concentration are regarded as promising materials in technological applications including multifunctional quantum devices and next-generation electronic devices."

    abs: "We investigated the role of the synthesis method and post-synthesis processing on the plasmonic properties of antimony-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals. The nanocrystal samples having variable doping concentrations were prepared by coprecipitation and solvothermal methods, and subsequently thermally annealed for different durations. We found that solvothermally-synthesized Sb-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonance in the near-infrared region, which is distinctly absent in the nanocrystals synthesized by the coprecipitation method. Upon thermal annealing, the plasmon absorption emerges in the nanocrystals prepared by the coprecipitation method, and increases in intensity in solvothermally-synthesized nanocrystals. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we correlated the plasmon intensity to the oxidation of Sb<sup>3+</sup> to Sb<sup>5+</sup>. These results demonstrate that synthesis methodology and post-synthesis treatment can dramatically influence the plasmonic properties of aliovalently doped semiconductor nanocrystals via dopant oxidation state, and can be effectively used to design semiconductor nanocrystals with targeted plasmonic properties."
